DRG - diagnosis - based on finance
Several DRG - MSD is the main one - 

ED - Emergency dept

Encounter a high level rollup: in patient (assigned bed), out patient, ED, other

lab orders - has lab components

payers (insurarers)

medication - administration + prescription ( + dispensing [not capturing outside pharmacy] - not complete data so excluded)

Procedure Order - surgery + consulations + interventions + xray (anything not medication + lab)

Surgical - very important - return on investment is high - optimize the number of surgery=ies per room
	surgery case = why done
	procedure events - as part of one surgery - might take do several things done at the same time to prevent reopening the patient
	supply use - supplies are expensive - titanium parts for knee
