DRG - diagnosis - based on finance
Several DRG - MSD is the main one - 

ED - Emergency dept

Encounter a high level rollup: in patient (assigned bed), out patient, ED, other

lab orders - has lab components

payers (insurarers)

medication - administration + prescription ( + dispensing [not capturing outside pharmacy] - not complete data so excluded)

Procedure Order - surgery + consulations + interventions + xray (anything not medication + lab)

Surgical - very important - return on investment is high - optimize the number of surgery=ies per room
	surgery case = why done
	procedure events - as part of one surgery - might take do several things done at the same time to prevent reopening the patient
	supply use - supplies are expensive - titanium parts for knee
	
Fiscal year - Oct - Sept

provider dim
userid -attribute - use to create role based security
just their patients
if head of dept, also see their subordinate Drs patients



when pulling meds prescribed by Dr, the amount returned by class is ok, but by drug name their are too many rows. Especially if they are head of Dept
because it also pulls in the drugs prescribed by their subordinates. Need to limit the queries to just the [Provider - UserID]
Medication - Pharmacological Class
Medication - Generic Name



MDX - Percentage of Total  - exclude  [...- Growth from Same Period Previous Year]

role security:
provider dim and user dim
OMid - get article from him


ratio of medications / encounter add to [Medication Order]
lab orders / encounter add to [Lab Order]


slice medications and lab orders by DRG dimension - modify dimension usage

linked server data analytics


Add ratios compared to previous year same interval.
ratio of medications / encounter add to [Medication Order]
lab orders / encounter add to [Lab Order]


Add the more measures


Add LDAP_USER in UserDim. Keep it hidden. Can LDAP_USER be hidden and still referenced?

Cube modifications: will be told by Shea

NUmber of tests in an outpatient setting.

tests by encounter by provider

tests in outpatient encounter 

lab orders by total number of encounters sliced by department

extract DSV file data and upload to SQL so it can be queried along with cube metadata
Also parse the dimension in addition to the DSV files


lab order count / encounter - count 
sliced by:
Provider - Lab Order - Authorizing
Date - Encounter

by location, Department


% of total
current fiscal
growth same fiscal year
Cancellation reason
by department
by current fiscal year
by date encounter



growth prev fiscal year

sproc percent and growth over prev fiscal

outpatient\

how many medication orders have been made by provider
apointment status is completed
combining medication in outpatient fact or encounter fact
inpatient - cannot tie 1-to-1 to provider (total num inpatient admissions that this provider has made a prescription use fact medication-Encounter)

opoid and scanned is MDX


provider and fiscal date cuts denomiator. numerator cut by everything


Use authorizing provider


scanned medication by scanned performed
sliced by user dimension user 

administration date - rate of change over time

 



sprocs create a table with measures
sort by measure name
sproc to write code to a file
add section tags
names with and without square brackets

files named 
Fiscal date
sort by name of measures
diagnosis - date
drg - by discharge inpatient
ed visit - arrival date 
encounter - encounter date
inpatient - discharge
lab component/lab order by date lab order - ordered
medication administration by performed date
medication order - date medication order
outpatient by encounter date
procedure by procedure ordered
surgery by date surgery

Calculated Measures
	Medication count, percentage of total, growth over past fiscal / number of completed encounters 
	Completed lab tests count, percentage of total, growth over past fiscal / number of completed encounters
MDX
	Opioid Medication count, percentage of total, growth over past fiscal / number of completed encounters by authorized provider by month for the current fiscal year
	Scanned administered medication and total administered medications that should be scanned by administered user by month for the current fiscal year


What is the completed encounter filter?
	Inpatient = everyone is included or [Date – Inpatient – Discharge] is populated
	Outpatient = Appointment Status = "Completed"
		PRESENT
		CANCELED
		HH INCOMPLETE
		NO SHOW
		ARRIVED
		LEFT WITHOUT SEEN
		SCHEDULED
		Unknown
	ED - Visit - [ED Visit].[ED Visit - Disposition] Exclude these items:
		ADMIT
		AMA
		DECEASED
		DISCHARGED
		ED OBSERVATION
		LWBS AFTER TRIAGE
		LWBS BEFORE TRIAGE
		SEND TO L&D
		TRANSFER TO ANOTHER FACILITY
		Unknown

		LEFT BEFORE TREATMENT COMPLETE - &[10] - include this one
		
	Encounter - [Encounter].[Encounter - Base Class] = ""
		EMERGENCY
		INPATIENT
		OTHER
		OUTPATIENT

 
	

Scanned administered medication?
	[Medication Administration - Medication Scan Performed] = "Yes"


total administered medications that should be scanned?
	[Medication Administration - Medication Scan Required].[Indicator] = "Yes"

Opioid filer? use [Medication - Opioid Indicator]
	[Medication].[Medication - Drug Enforcement Agency Class] = 
		C-II HIGH ABUSE POTENTIAL
		C-III MODERATE DEPENDENCE

		FYI (Do no filter on this)
			C-IV LIMITED DEPENDENCE
			C-V LIMITED ABUSE POTENTIAL
			UNDETERMINABLE
			Unknown
			
	[Medication].[Medication - Generic Name] = 
		MD.GNRC_NM like ''%TRAMADOL%'' 
		or MD.GNRC_NM like ''%CODEINE%''




Completed lab tests filter?
	[Lab Order].[Lab Order - Verification Status] = "completed" 
		CANCELED
		COMPLETED
		RESULTED
		SENT
		Unknown
