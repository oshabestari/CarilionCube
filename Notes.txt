DRG - diagnosis - based on finance
Several DRG - MSD is the main one - 

ED - Emergency dept

Encounter a high level rollup: in patient (assigned bed), out patient, ED, other

lab orders - has lab components

payers (insurarers)

medication - administration + prescription ( + dispensing [not capturing outside pharmacy] - not complete data so excluded)

Procedure Order - surgery + consulations + interventions + xray (anything not medication + lab)

Surgical - very important - return on investment is high - optimize the number of surgery=ies per room
	surgery case = why done
	procedure events - as part of one surgery - might take do several things done at the same time to prevent reopening the patient
	supply use - supplies are expensive - titanium parts for knee
	
Fiscal year - Oct - Sept

provider dim
userid -attribute - use to create role based security
just their patients
if head of dept, also see their subordinate Drs patients



when pulling meds prescribed by Dr, the amount returned by class is ok, but by drug name their are too many rows. Especially if they are head of Dept
because it also pulls in the drugs prescribed by their subordinates. Need to limit the queries to just the [Provider - UserID]
Medication - Pharmacological Class
Medication - Generic Name



MDX - Percentage of Total  - exclude  [...- Growth from Same Period Previous Year]

role security:
provider dim and user dim
OMid - get article from him


ratio of medications / encounter add to [Medication Order]
lab orders / encounter add to [Lab Order]


slice medications and lab orders by DRG dimension - modify dimension usage

linked server data analytics


Add ratios compared to previous year same interval.
ratio of medications / encounter add to [Medication Order]
lab orders / encounter add to [Lab Order]


Add the more measures


Add LDAP_USER in UserDim. Keep it hidden. Can LDAP_USER be hidden and still referenced?

Cube modifications: will be told by Shea

NUmber of tests in an outpatient setting.

tests by encounter by provider

tests in outpatient encounter 

lab orders by total number of encounters sliced by department

extract DSV file data and upload to SQL so it can be queried along with cube metadata
Also parse the dimension in addition to the DSV files
